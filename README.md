In this app I use Coin Paprika API for data , Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection , MVVM as design Pattern , Retrofit for API calling , Jetpack Compose for UI Designing.
This app has two screens. One is for showing the list of all coins and other one is for showing the detail of that particular coin.
